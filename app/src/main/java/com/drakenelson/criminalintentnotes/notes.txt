page 176 is where the screen starts to get filled

recyclerView holds ViewHolders
each viewholder holds a view

recyclerView works with an adapter to keep things full
the adapter fills things in

gradle: dependency manager that

add the maven dependency com.android.support:recyclerview

the adapter is the connection between the view and database;
we use an arraylist in the adapter to hold a list of crimes
when we create a viewholder it creates a blank list of crimes
getItemCount figures out how many items there are
onBindViewHolder puts a specific piece of data in a specific view (plug-in)
